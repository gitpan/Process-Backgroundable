Changes for Perl Extension Process-Backgroundable

	- No functional changes
	- Updating to Module::Install 0.76
	- Removed the use of base

0.20 Sun  1 Jul 2007
	- Unlike the rest of the Process family, Process::Backgroundable
	  does not work properly on Windows. So it is being seperated out
	  into a distribution on its own to prevent imposing a limitation
	  on the main collection of Process modules.
