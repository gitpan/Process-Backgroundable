NAME
    Process::Backgroundable - A Process::Storable object that can be
    backgrounded

SYNOPSIS
      # Background a finite length process
      MyCacheCleaner->new( dir => '...', maxsize => '10 meg' )->background;
  
      # Background an infinite length process
      MyWebServer->new( dir => '...' )->background;

DESCRIPTION
    "Process::Backgroundable" extends Process::Storable for the purpose of
    create process objects that can be run in the background and detached
    from the main process.

    It adds a "background" method that (rather than fork), launches a new
    copy of Perl, passing the Process to it using Process::Launcher, which
    will load and execute the process.

    Please note that both the "STDOUT" and "STDERR" for the backgrounded
    process will be sent to /dev/null (or your equivalent) so there is no
    way to recieve any output from the background process, and you will not
    be notified if it exits.

    If you want to add logging or locks or some other feature to your
    backgrounded process, that is your responsibility, and you set them up
    in the "prepare" method.

METHODS
    This method inherits all the normal methods from Process and in addition
    inherits the strict seperation of responsibility described in
    Process::Storable. You should be aware of both of these.

  background
    The "background" is provided by default, and will start another instance
    of the same Perl you are current running, although not necesarily with
    the same environment.

    This allows you to use "Process::Backgroundable" in very large
    applications that may contain other data that will not be so amenable to
    normal forking.

BUGS
    This is implemented with IPC::Run3 calls for now, but we might have to
    move to Proc::Background for more robustness later on.
